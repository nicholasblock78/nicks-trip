		<h2><em>What</em> am I doing?</h2>
		<p>I'm embarking upon a massive journey this fall. Come Labor Day, I will have finished my classes and physical therapy for my shoulder. My lease also ends in September. Quite literally, I will be a free man. Nothing to hold me back from pursuing my dreams. </p>
		<p></p>

		<h2><em>Why</em> am I doing this?</h2>
		<p>Many of you do not know I had a similar type of trip planned a year ago. I was going to fly to San Francisco, interview and see friends, then rent a car and drive up the coast to Seattle. From there, I would fly back. I was going to fly out on Frontier a couple weeks after the first initial Ebola victim flew on a Frontier plane. I was going by myself and I let Ebola be my excuse to not go, even though I didn't want to go alone at the time. This decision came after everything had been booked and airfare paid for. Of course. (I used miles to grab a couple cheap one ways. So no money lost technically, but such a waste.) </p>
		<p>This time around I'm ready! </p>


		<h2><em>How</em> it came to be</h2>
		<p>As you'll see below, I used a National Park Road Atlas with tracing paper. I went through with pencil and circled everything I wanted to see. (My goal was to visit warm places plus Boston because these are places I might try to move to.) Once I circled to my heart's content, I simply connected the dots. I had the general idea of moving East first, even though West makes more sense, so I started connecting from Chicago going East. View the process <a href="process.html">here.</a></p>
